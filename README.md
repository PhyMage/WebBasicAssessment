CDN API - Complete Developer Network API
CDN API is a RESTful Web API that allows you to manage user data for the Complete Developer Network. It provides endpoints for registering, updating, deleting, and retrieving user information.


Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET 5.0 or later
A relational database (e.g., SQL Server) with a configured connection string.
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cdn-api.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd cdn-api
Update the database connection string in appsettings.json to point to your database.

Run the application:


dotnet run
The API will be accessible at https://localhost:5001 (or http://localhost:5000).

Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

GET /api/users: Get a list of all registered users.
POST /api/users: Register a new user.
PUT /api/users/{id}: Update an existing user's information by ID.
DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete a user by ID.
Validation
The API includes validation for user data:

Username: Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed.
Phone Number: Only numbers are allowed.
Mail: Must be a valid email address.
Validation errors are returned with descriptive error messages.

Database
The API uses Entity Framework Core to interact with a relational database. The database schema includes a Users table to store user information.

Usage
You can use tools like Postman, Swagger, or your favorite HTTP client to interact with the API. Here are some example requests:

Get All Users
GET /api/users

Register a New User
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "username": "newuser",
  "mail": "newuser@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890",
  "skillsets": "Web Development",
  "hobby": "Reading"
}

Update User Information
PUT /api/users/{id}
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "mail": "updateduser@example.com"
}

Delete a User
DELETE /api/users/{id}
